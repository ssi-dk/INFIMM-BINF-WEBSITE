# Analyze scRNA-seq data by Bioconductor

Bioconductor, Seurat, and Scanpy are three popular ecosystems for analyzing scRNA-seq data. 

Bioconductor is a project which develops, supports and shares free open source software with a focus on rigorous and reproducible analysis of data for many different biological assays including single-cell. A homogeneous developer and user experience and extensive documentation with user friendly vignettes are the biggest strengths of Bioconductor. Seurat is a well regarded R package specifically designed for the analysis of single-cell data. It offers tooling for all steps of the analysis including multimodal and spatial data. The well written vignettes and the large user-base is what Seurat is known for. However, both R options can run into scalability issues for extremely large datasets (more than half a million cells) which motivated the Python based community to develop the scverse ecosystem. scverse is an organization and an ecosystem dedicated to foundational tools in the life sciences with an initial focus on single-cell. Scalability, extendability and strong interoperability with the existing Python data and machine learning tooling are some of the advantages of the scverse ecosystem.
