# using renv to manage R packages in a project

## Introduction
renv is a package that helps you manage R packages in a project. renv enables you to create a project-specific library of R packages. It is very flexible, allowing you to use any R package repository, including CRAN, Bioconductor, and GitHub.

## Installation
renv is available on CRAN, so you can install it with `install.packages()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("renv")
```

## Restore a previously saved project

```{r eval=FALSE}
renv::restore()
```

## Initializing a project

```{r eval=FALSE}
renv::init()
```

### When packages have been changed
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
renv::snapshot()
```
